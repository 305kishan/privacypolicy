## Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: {{DATE}}*

Apex Tab — F1 Wallpapers (Unofficial) is designed with a simple principle: **your data belongs to you**. This extension does not collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal information. All functionality runs locally within your browser.

## 1. **Information We Do Not Collect**

Apex Tab does **not** collect, store, or transmit:

* Personal data
* Browsing history
* Search queries
* Cookies
* IP addresses
* Identifiers or analytics
* Any information that can be used to identify you

We do not use analytics tools, trackers, or advertising networks.

## 2. **Information Stored Locally (On Your Device Only)**

The extension stores a small amount of data **locally on your device** using Chrome’s `storage` API to support the following features:

* Your chosen wallpaper settings (blur, dim level)
* Quick links you add or edit
* The last used wallpaper
* UI preferences

This data never leaves your browser and is **not transmitted to any server**.

---

## 3. **External Requests**

Apex Tab makes requests **only to the wallpaper image provider** used to fetch background images. These requests:

* Are standard HTTP image fetches
* Do **not** contain personal data
* Are never processed or logged by the extension
* Retrieve **content only**, not executable code

No other remote servers are contacted.

## 4. **Permissions Usage**

### Storage Permission

Used only to save local preferences such as quick links and visual settings.

### Host Permission

Used exclusively to fetch wallpaper images from the selected image provider.

### History Permission

Used only to allow Chrome’s built‑in autocomplete in the search bar. The extension does **not** read, store, or analyze your history.

## 5. **Data Sharing and Selling**

* Does **not** share data
* Does **not** sell data
* Does **not** track users

We have no servers, databases, or backend systems receiving any information.

## 6. **Children’s Privacy**

## 7. **Open Source / Transparency**

If you review the extension package, you will see that all logic runs locally and no external code is executed.

---

## 8. **Changes to This Policy**

Any future changes will be reflected in this document. Because the extension does not process personal data, changes will remain minimal and focused on clarity.
